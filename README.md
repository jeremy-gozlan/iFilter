##iFilter

iFilter is an iOS application that allows one user to take a camera shot of a sneaker, segment the image into sneakers-background and apply filters to each of them independently. This project was realized as a self initiated project for the INF573 - Image Analysis and Computer Vision at Ecole Polytechnique. 

The dataset was created by hand using LabelMe to create annotated mask images of sneakers. 

I used the Unet architecture for segmentation as well as the Segnet.


Step 1: Be sure to have all packages/softwares installed. 

Segmentation: 

Python 3.7

-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-keras ( 2.2.5)
-tensorflow (1.15.0)
