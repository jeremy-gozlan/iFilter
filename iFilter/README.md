Hello ! In order to fully replicate the results shown in the report, please follow these steps:


Step 1: Be sure to have all packages/softwares installed. 

Segmentation: 

Python 3.7

-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-keras ( 2.2.5)
-tensorflow (1.15.0)


iFilter iOS application:  

Software/language:
Xcode 11
Swift 5

Package:
SwiftImage library
Carthage


Step 2: Reproduce the model building/training/conversion by running the Segmentation.ipynb
The training dataset (295Dataset2) has been already formatted and ready to use for the Segmentation.ipynb.

Step 3: Run the app by launching the iFilter .xcodeproj. You will need an iPhone.  If you do not want to run the app but only look at the code. I consider looking at the two main views. The ViewController.swift ( Capture View)  and the  SegmentationAlertView.swift ( Segmentation View) files.

Thank you and hope you enjoy the application!
